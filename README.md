# What's Ago?!
Ago is a small static blog generator without any fuzz. It's stupidly simple, not at all built upon any of the fanciest algorithms or the most widely tested libraries. It's small, simple and works!

# Installation

## Binaries
Well, if you wanna be lazy and use a pre-compiled binary simply download the one hosted [here](https://github.com/dvwallin/ago/raw/master/binaries/ago-linux-amd64) on github.

## Manual install
Wanna be a fancy nerd? Well simply move into your $GOPATH and do
```go get github.com/dvwallin/ago && cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dvwallin/ago && go install```
then enjoy!
